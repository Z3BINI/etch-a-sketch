# etch-a-sketch

Third TOP project!

Very excited for this one, it was fun to make and I learned a lot.

These we're the challenges given by the TOP curriculum:

A grid of divs that change colors when the mouse cursor passes over them.
The grid size can be dynamic.
The coloring has a 'darkening' effect, getting darker every time it gets painted.
A RGB mode that will color with a random color.

Excited for the other challenges to come!
